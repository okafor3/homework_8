          summary: "Red-green color blindness is a form of colorblindness in which red and green are perceived as identical. This is the most common type of colorblindness. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and affects 6% of males Males have only 1 X chromosome, from their mother. If that X chromosome has the gene for red-green color blindness (instead of a normal X chromosome), they will have red-green color blindness. Females have 2 X chromosomes, one from their mother and one from their father. To have red-green color blindness, both X chromosomes would need to have the gene for red-green color blindness.",
          funfact: "Babies are born color blind! As they grow, their color vision improves and is typically fully developed by the age of 6 months.",

          id: "complete",
          header: "Complete Color Blindness",
          summary: "Complete color blindness is the only type that fully lives up to the term “color blind”. Achromatopsia is a relatively uncommon disorder, with a prevalence of 1 in 30,000 people. Those who have achromatopsia only see the world in shades of grey, black and white. Depending on the type, you may also have trouble seeing clearly and you may be more sensitive to light. There is generally no treatment to cure achromatopsia. However, dark red or plum colored filters are very helpful in controlling light sensitivity.",
          funfact: "It’s possible to be color blind in one eye and have normal color vision in the other! This is called unilateral dichromacy and it’s very rare.",

		var title3 = {
          id: "blueyellow",
          header: "Blue Yellow Color Blindness",
          summary: "If you have blue-yellow color blindness, blue and green will look alike, and red and yellow will look alike. Tritanopia occurs when the S-cones of the eye are missing, which causes colors to look dampened. like red and green color blindness, blue yellow color blindness is not more prominent in males, as the gene that causes the S cones to be absent or defective is not found on the X chromosome, but rather chromosome 7. An injury through a hard hit to the front or back of your head may cause blue-yellow color blindness.",
          funfact: "In Romania, color blind people are not allowed to obtain a driver’s license. In England, color blindness may prevent you from becoming a doctor.",
